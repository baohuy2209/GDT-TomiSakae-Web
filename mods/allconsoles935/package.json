This mod expands your experience by adding 100 consoles (even more with Part 2 of the mod!).\n\n[h2]Requirements, Recommendations & Compatibility:[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Requires UltimateLib  \n[*] Due to GDT's limitations, this mod is split into two parts. Subscribe to Part 2 to unlock 75 more consoles!  \n[*] TAG mod overhauls the whole UI and makes the game look modern! Check it out!  \n[*] It's compatible with almost every mod, but I wouldn't recommend adding another mod that also adds more consoles... or using a 10 year old mod for that matter.  \n[/list]\n\n[h2]üìú Update Log:[/h2]\n(2025-03-15)  \n- Remade Units sold (Again) overall increesed the marketshare of most consoles\n- Removed DS lite\n- Added Dendy \n- Fixed better pictures for some consoles\n- Other small fixes\n\n(2025-03-13) \n- Basically remade the whole mod and mod page.\n- Resized all images to fit nicely.  \n- Fixed unit sales numbers to be accurate with GDT's logic (which makes no sense).  \n- Fixed the name of Virtual boy.\n\n(2025-03-12)  \n- Updated all console release & discontinuation dates to align with GDT‚Äôs unconventional format.  \n\nüëâ Full update history in the built-in Steam Changelog!\n\n[h2]üìú Full Console List:[/h2]  \nWant to see all 100+ consoles included in both mods?

Probably not.  \nDid I do it anyway? Absolutely... Now i can sleep Zzzz\n\n[i]First pic: Sales calculations for irl sales to fit in-game sales. Second pic: Calculations how irl dates compare to in-game dates.[/i]\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/17HT3aF.png[/img]\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/pliXyFc.png[/img]\n\n[h2]üí¨ Support & Feedback:[/h2]  \nFound a bug or know another console that should be added?
