This mod expands your experience by adding 100 consoles (even more with Part 2 of the mod!).\n\n[h2]Requirements, Recommendations & Compatibility:[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Requires UltimateLib  \n[*] Due to GDT's limitations, this mod is split into two parts. Subscribe to Part 2 to unlock 75 more consoles!  \n[*] TAG mod overhauls the whole UI and makes the game look modern! Check it out!  \n[*] It's compatible with almost every mod, but I wouldn't recommend adding another mod that also adds more consoles... or using a 10 year old mod for that matter.  \n[/list]\n\n[h2]üìú Update Log:[/h2]\n(2025-03-15)  \n- Remade Units sold (Again) overall increesed the marketshare of most consoles\n- Removed DS lite\n- Added Dendy \n- Fixed better pictures for some consoles\n- Other small fixes\n\n(2025-03-13) \n- Basically remade the whole mod and mod page.\n- Resized all images to fit nicely.  \n- Fixed unit sales numbers to be accurate with GDT's logic (which makes no sense).  \n- Fixed the name of Virtual boy.\n\n(2025-03-12)  \n- Updated all console release & discontinuation dates to align with GDT's unconventional format.  \n\nüëâ Full update history in the built-in Steam Changelog!\n\n[h2]üìú Full Console List:[/h2]  \nWant to see all 100+ consoles included in both mods? Check out the full list here:  \nüëâ [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/11zj14A9beMTxvGt5jojbzfZ2XIVKVrXMj981eDLM0eQ/edit?usp=sharing]List[/url]\n\n[h2]üõ†Ô∏è How to Install:[/h2]\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Subscribe to this mod.  \n2Ô∏è‚É£ Subscribe to All The Consoles Mod [Part 2].  \n3Ô∏è‚É£ Subscribe to UltimateLib.  \n4Ô∏è‚É£ Enable all mods in the mod menu by clicking them (The built in API mod aswell).\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Restart the game to activate the mods and enjoy!  \n\n[h2]üìä What It Took To Make This Mod[/h2]\nThis graph represents the [b]sheer insanity[/b] I went through to make sure every console had [b]accurate release dates and sales numbers so it would make sense with the vanilla consoles[/b].\n\nDid I need to do this? Probably not.  \nDid I do it anyway? Absolutely... Now i can sleep Zzzz\n\n[i]First pic: Sales calculations for irl sales to fit in-game sales. Second pic: Calculations how irl dates compare to in-game dates.[/i]\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/17HT3aF.png[/img]\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/pliXyFc.png[/img]\n\n[h2]üí¨ Support & Feedback:[/h2]  \nFound a bug or know another console that should be added? Leave a comment below!  \n\n[h2]‚≠ê Enjoy the Mod? Support It! ‚≠ê[/h2]  \nGive it a thumbs up & favorite!\nI have spent over 100 hours working on this mod, so I would really appreciate it!  \nIt also helps more people find it and keeps updates coming! üöÄ  \n\n\n[quote=Yoda]Do or do not, there is no try[/quote]",
